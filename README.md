# Description
A collection of code and projects used to complete various certifications I'm working on. Details about each project will be sectioned in this description. Details will include modificaitons I needed to make, goals I completed, and the tools I needed to use. A variety of these projects contains partially completed code and specific tools to test/grade them on the certification website, which may not be relevant here but are included. This servers as a back-up of code and proof of partial completion before recieving a certification itself.

## Data Analysis with Python
From freecodecamp.org "read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data". The completion of this certification is broken up into 5 projects. All 5 projects are completed on replit.com imported from the freecodecamp's provided git repo.

* Uploaded zips of replit, including boilerplate files and data. All provided by freecodecamp.org

### Medical Data Visualizer
Using a given CSV for medical data, I'm asked to visualize it by reformating the data and posting it to various types of plots/maps
- Import CSV into pandas variable
- flatten data into long form groups of medical data to a patients ID
- Reformat data to group it by cardio, showing each individual feature
- Send reformated data to a matplotlib Categorical Plot
