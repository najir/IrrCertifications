# Description
A collection of code and projects used to complete various certifications I'm working on. Details about each project will be sectioned in this description. Details will include modificaitons I needed to make, goals I completed, and the tools I needed to use. A variety of these projects contains partially completed code and specific tools to test/grade them on the certification website, which may not be relevant here but are included. This servers as a back-up of code and proof of partial completion before recieving a certification itself.

## Data Analysis with Python
From freecodecamp.org "read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data". The completion of this certification is broken up into 5 projects. All 5 projects are completed on replit.com imported from the freecodecamp's provided git repo.

* Uploaded zips of replit, including boilerplate files and data. All provided by freecodecamp.org

### Mean-Varience-Standard Deviation Calculator
To be filled in

### Demographic Data Analyzer
To be filled in

### Medical Data Visualizer
Using a given CSV for medical data, I'm asked to visualize it by reformating the data and posting it to various types of plots/maps
- Import CSV into pandas variable
- flatten data into long form groups of medical data to a patients ID
- Reformat data to group it by cardio, showing each individual feature
- Send reformated data to a matplotlib Categorical Plot

### Page View Time Series Visualizer
A CSV provides date and view amounts of forum page views for freecodecamp.org.
- Import CSV file and parse data to organaize date values into pandas series and properly index the dataframe
- Remove outlier data for page views, high and low end
- Organize date formats, group data into various forms based on year/month
- Create a Line Plot containing total dates and values from the file
- Create a bar-plot sorted by month on the x-axis and grouped by year. Colored and placed on a legend
- Create 2 box-plots, one for yearly for trending views and the other monthly for seasonal differences

### Sea Level Predictor
Not-Completed
